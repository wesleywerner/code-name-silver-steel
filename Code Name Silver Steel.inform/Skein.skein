A freelance spy is a great job. It pays well and you get to travel to new and interesting places. Unless you get caught, that part is not so great.

You tear open the unmarked envelope and unfold the mission briefing enclosed within: Infiltrate MegaCorp, gain access to the data centre, download the database.

So here you are, one week later - standing in the foyer of MegaCorp, under guise as a repairman.

Code Name Silver Steel
An Interactive Fiction by Special Agent
Release 1 / Serial number 170423 / Inform 7 build 6M62 (I6/v6.33 lib 6/12N) SD

Foyer
The spacious foyer of the MegaCorp building carries indistinguishable sounds along the sterile tiled floor and angular furniture, giving the impression of cold detachment.

You are standing by the reception desk in the centre of the room. The raised desk shields the small stature of the person behind it, oblivious to your presence.

To the north is an elevator, and a door beside it. 

(New players should type &quot;help&quot;)

You can see a receptionist here.
