# Room descriptions

I thought some of the wording in the intro was a little bit odd. For example, "The spacious foyer ... carries indistinguishable sounds along the sterile tiled floor and angular furniture" How does a foyer carry sounds? Sounds also don't usually travel along the floor, and I can't figure out how they would travel "along angular furniture." It feels like you are trying to cram too much into this first sentence. What about: "Indistinguishable murmuring(?) greets you in the spacious foyer of the MegaCorp Building. The sterile tiled floor and angular furniture give an impression of cold detachment." The second sentence of the next paragraph is also a little odd: "The raised desk shields the small stature of the person behind it...." The desk shields the stature of the person? Maybe: "The raised desk shields the short person behind it...." This may seem really nitpicky, but the intro is where the player gets their first impression of your game.
